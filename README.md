This is the first HTML and CSS project through The Odin Project.
As the name suggests, this is a simple replica of the desktop version of the Google Homepage (June 2020)

Skills demonstrated:
- Flexbox (used for the body, main section, and navs)
- Positioning vertically and horizontally in flexbox containers
- Positioning multiple nav uls on the same line in opposite corners
- Changing default web browser behavior on things like input outlines when they're focused
- Using CSS psuedo-selectors such as :hover
- Using CSS attribute selectors such as input[type=submit]
- Creating a sticky footer using flexbox
